ALTER TABLE trains
ADD COLUMN arrival_time TIME;

-- 15.) Modify the data type of the 'ticket_number' column in
-- the 'passengers' table:
-- ALTER TABLE passengers
-- MODIFY COLUMN ticket_number VARCHAR(30);

CREATE TABLE routes (
 route_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
 route_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

-- 17.) Add a foreign key constraint to the 'bookings' table:
ALTER TABLE bookings
ADD FOREIGN KEY (passenger_id) REFERENCES 
passengers(passenger_id);

-- 18.) Filter the data where station_id=2:
SELECT * FROM passengers WHERE station_id = 2;

-- 19.) Filter the data where booking_date>=â€™2023-09-11:
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE booking_date >= '2023-09-11';

-- 20.) Sort the passenger_name in ascending order:
SELECT * FROM passengers ORDER BY passenger_name ASC;

-- 21.) Sort the train in descending order:
SELECT * FROM trains ORDER BY capacity DESC;

-- 22.) Use aggregate function Count on passenger:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS passenger_count FROM passengers;

-- 23.) Use aggregate function Average on passenger:
SELECT AVG(capacity) AS average_capacity FROM trains;

-- 24.) Use aggregate function Max on booking_date:
SELECT MAX(booking_date) AS latest_booking FROM bookings;

-- 25.) Use aggregate function Min on booking_date:
SELECT MIN(booking_date) AS latest_booking FROM bookings;

-- 26.) Grouping data:
SELECT station_id, COUNT(*) AS passenger_count
FROM passengers
GROUP BY station_id;

-- Functions:
-- 27.) Use string function concat on passengers:
-- SELECT CONCAT(passenger_name, ' - ', ticket_number) AS 
-- passenger_info FROM passengers;

-- 28.) Use string function Upper on trains:
SELECT UPPER(train_name) AS uppercase_train_name FROM trains;

-- 29.) Use string function Lower on trains:
SELECT LOWER(train_name) AS uppercase_train_name FROM trains;

-- 30.) Use Date function current date:
SELECT CURDATE() AS current_date;

-- 31.) Use Date format on bookings:
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(booking_date, '%Y-%m-%d') AS 
formatted_date FROM bookings;

-- 32.) Use math function sqrt on capacity:
SELECT SQRT(capacity) AS square_root_capacity FROM trains;

-- 33.) Use math function round on capacity:
SELECT ROUND(AVG(capacity), 2) AS rounded_average_capacity
FROM trains;

-- 34.) Use conditional function on passengers:
SELECT passenger_name, CASE WHEN station_id = 1 THEN 'At Station 
A' ELSE 'Not at Station A' END AS location_info
FROM passengers;

-- 38.) Find passengers and their booked train names using 
-- inner join:
